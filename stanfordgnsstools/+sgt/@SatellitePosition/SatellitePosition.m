classdef SatellitePosition < matlab.mixin.Copyable
    % SatellitePosition     a container for the position of a satellite at
    %   a given time in both LLH and ECEF coordinates.
    %
    %   p = sgt.SatellitePosition(satellite, time, posType, pos)
    %   creates a SatellitePosition from a satellite (satellite) at a given
    %   time (time). The position type is specified by posType (either
    %   'llh' or 'ecef') with the position given by pos. The constructor
    %   will automatically compute the other position type so that the
    %   resulting SatellitePosition contains both types of positions. For a
    %   single satellite, time and pos, the result is a single 
    %   SatellitePosition. If satellite is an array of S satellite and time
    %   is a scalar, position must be an Sx3 matrix of the position of each
    %   S satellites at the given time and the output will be a Sx1 array.
    %   For a single satellite and T times, the pos array must be a 3xT
    %   array and the output will be a 1xT array.  For S satellites and T
    %   times, the pos input must be an Sx3xT matrix and the output will be
    %   an SxT matrix.
